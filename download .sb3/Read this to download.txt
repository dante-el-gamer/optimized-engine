Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't allow me to upload files larger than 25MB, so I uploaded the Turbowarp project file to Google Drive. You can download it from there (this isn't the playable version, it's the source code/editable version, but that doesn't matter): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LGcHoTYUHmWMWzjwELPARdunKnCnS8E9/view
