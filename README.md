Welcome to **Optimized Engine**!
A cleaner, faster, and beginner-friendly FNF engine built so that even users with minimal modding experience can create their own mod with ease. 🚀

## 📦 Repo Contents

* **optimized-engine.sb3** → Main Turbowarp project adapted into the optimized engine.
* **📁 folder** → Contains a text file with a download link for the main file (over 25MB, so it’s not hosted directly on GitHub).
* **credits.txt**

---

## 🚀 Features

* Performance-focused and speed-optimized (currently in beta, but actively improving).
* Runs smoothly on mid-range hardware — with more performance boosts planned soon.

creator's note:
 If you like this little indie project and wanna know more, just read this. I know it’s not a lot, but it’s some cool tiny bits.

Did you know this “team” is not even a real team? It’s just one or two people. One is me, Dante, and the other is a YouTuber called dinogam3r. He’s the tester and also a really good friend. And yeah, did you know I’m actually a kid/teen? Yup, you read that right. I’m a kid who made all of this (well, most of it, because I used a base; I would never try to make FNF from zero in Scratch, that’s way too crazy).

And honestly, being just one person makes everything easier. No long talks, no arguments, no giant planning sessions. Everything comes straight from the big world called Earth—haha no, I mean (for real now) imagination. The place where everything is possible… and yeah, everyone with an IQ above 0 has imagination (some more than others), they know it. So yeah, fewer people means the optimized engine is easier to work on, and I kinda hope it stays like that.

This is a project I really love because it mixes two things I enjoy: programming and games. Games are my favorite, obviously. I don’t play a ton of them, but I have a Nintendo Switch and I always try to finish everything a game has. On Roblox, I like playing If you like this little indie project and wanna know more, just read this. I know it’s not a lot, but it’s some cool tiny bits.

This is a project I really love because it mixes two things I enjoy: programming and games. Games are my favorite, obviously. I don’t play a ton of them, but I have a Nintendo Switch and I always try to finish everything a game has. On Roblox, I like playing the thousands of… “experiences”? Why are they even called that? And by the way, in Fortnite I’m actually pretty good. In the Simpsons season I have 28 wins (November 15, 2025). And in Minecraft, I have a super good private hardcore server (well, it’s just a normal survival server because cough cough it’s Minecraft Bedrock… and if you do technical stuff or dumb experiments you know exactly what that means: random deaths, flying for no reason, weird AFK moments, getting launched in the air, dying from an arrow out of nowhere, etc.).

And well, whoa, I kinda wrote too much hahaha. What am I even saying? This is turning into FNAF lore lol. Anyway, goodbye, I’m ending this text now, bye-bye.the thousands of… “experiences”?
