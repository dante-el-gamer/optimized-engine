### Contributing to _Optimized Engine_

---

If you encounter an _error,_ **verify that it wasn't a system error or if you were using a different operating system version.**

When reporting a bug, clearly describe what happened, what you expected to happen, what error appeared, and indicate the engine version you downloaded. If possible, include steps to reproduce the problem, as well as screenshots, videos, or console logs.

To propose new features, open [Gmail](https://gmail.com) and write to [contacto.danteelgamer@gmail.com](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&to=contacto.danteelgamer%40gmail.com&su=ERROR%20-%20Optimized%20Engine!!!!&tf=cm), describing the usefulness of the idea and how it would benefit the project. If you wish to send a YouTube video, ensure the email is clear, organized, and does not include unnecessary files.

We welcome contributions focused on many things, such as bug fixes, optional improvements, and useful tools for modders. Changes that break compatibility, add unnecessarily heavy code, or include copyrighted content are NOT allowed (unless it's a port, but that would be up to you).

If we make any changes thanks to you, your credits will be added to the ```credits.txt```, and you'll be listed in ```credits.txt``` and the description. To be credited, just give us your first and last name or a name of your own. If you have a social media profile, send us the link, and we'll add you as a link in the descriptions and credits.txt.

_Thank you for your interest in the project._

Sincerely, [Dante el Gamer](https://youtube.com/@danteelgameryt)
